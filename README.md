## Feature Branches
A repository was set up in GitHub which was used as the version control system (VCS) for the project.  The repository was added to a GitHub project and an automated kanban style board was initiated in GitHub to record user stories as issues to be worked on.

A feature branch model was used to develop the features for application.  Each user story was raised as an issue in GitHub project and the feature branches were created as branches of dev, itself a branch of main, with the naming convention "feature/(GitHub issue number)-short-description".  For example "feature/3-create-items".
